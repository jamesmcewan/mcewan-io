# An intro...

I'm James McEwan, a maker of things, including, but not limited to full stack web engineering, illustration, design and some hardware hacking when I have the time.

I've been building things for the web since the late nineties. At the moment I mostly work with JavaScript to craft some pretty fun web apps.
