# Hi Folks!

For a over a decade I’ve worked as a Web Developer on an array of cool projects for some amazing clients. I love working with JavaScript and crafting great and accessible web apps.

Among my favourite things in this world, are coffee, drawing, comic books, cartoons from the 80s and a damn good burrito.

If you’ve got a project you’d like me to take a look at, or just want to discuss code, comics or movie monsters then Get in touch!
